[Verse 1: Haerin, Danielle, Hanni]
Look, it's a new me
Switched it up, who's this?
우릴 봐 NewJeans
So fresh, so clean
얼마나
기다렸던 날
드디어
Time to step out
또 한 번 더
Ready for sure
To have some more

[Chorus: Minji, Hyein]
New hair, new tee
NewJeans, do you see?
New hair, new tee
NewJeans, do you see?
New hair, new tee
NewJeans, do you see?
New hair, new tee
NewJeans, do you see?

[Refrain: Haerin, Minji, Hyein, Danielle]
Make it feel like a game
Look at us, we go on and on again
We'll go on to the end
What we wanna do, on and on again
Make it feel like a game
Look at us, we go on and on again
We'll go on to the end
What we wanna do, on and on again
[Verse 2: Hanni, Hyein, Danielle]
Look, it's a new me
Switched it up, who's this?
들어봐 NewJeans
So fresh, so clean
얼마나
기다렸던 날
드디어
Feeling's so right
또 한 번 더
I need to know
You want some more

[Chorus: Haerin, Danielle]
New hair, new tee
NewJeans, you and me
New hair, new tee
NewJeans, you and me
New hair, new tee
NewJeans, you and me
New hair, new tee
NewJeans, you and me
