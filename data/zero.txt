[Verse 1: Danielle, Haerin]
정말 짜릿했어 어디선가
내게 윙크한 까만 눈동자
Boy, your beautiful eyes got me lost now
Yeah, yeah
깜짝 놀라게 하기는 해도
자신만만한 너의 그 태도
Liked you from the get go
Cool함은 그대로
부담감은 제로

[Refrain: Hanni, Hyein]
'Cause you know you're sparkling
Like a shooting star, I can see us going far
얼마나 상큼할까
We will pop up all around the world (World)
마법 같은 걸 (걸)
I'm ready, let's go (Go)
You already know (Know, know, know)

[Pre-Chorus: Minji]
That I don't ever want us to be
I don't ever want us to be
I don't ever want us to be apart, yeah
I don't ever want us to be
I don't ever want us to be apart
[Chorus: Hanni, Minji, Hyein, Danielle]
코-코-코-코-코-코
코카콜라 맛있다
코카콜라 맛있다
See you looking, catch it, here's your Cola
See you looking, catch it, here's your Cola
코카콜라 맛있다
코카콜라 맛있다
See you looking, catch it, here's your Cola
See you looking, catch it, here's your Cola

[Verse 2: Haerin, Hanni]
사실 궁금했어
저기선가
내 눈에 띄던 까만 네 글자
Boy, your stylish glow up
Got me hookеd now
Yeah, yeah
살짝 짓궂게 보이긴 해도
완전 달달한 너의 그 애교
Liked you from thе get go
Sweet함은 그대로
불안감은 제로

[Refrain: Hyein, Danielle]
'Cause you know you're sparkling
Like a shooting star, I can see us going far
얼마나 상큼할까
We will pop up all around the world (World)
마법 같은 걸 (걸)
I'm ready, let's go (Go)
You already know (Know, know, know)
[Pre-Chorus: Hanni]
That I don't ever want us to be
I don't ever want us to be
I don't ever want us to be apart, yeah
I don't ever want us to be
I don't ever want us to be apart

[Chorus: Minji, Haerin, Danielle, Hanni]
코-코-코-코-코-코
코카콜라 맛있다
코카콜라 맛있다
See you looking, catch it, here's your Cola
See you looking, catch it, here's your Cola
코카콜라 맛있다
코카콜라 맛있다
See you looking, catch it, here's your Cola
See you looking, catch it, here's your Cola
