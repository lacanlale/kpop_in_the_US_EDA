[Verse 1: Hyein, Danielle]
You know me like no other
다 표현하지 않아도
See me like no other (Mm)
And I think I like your point of view
다시 돌아와도 돼
I don't care what other people say
놓지 말아봐줘
Dreaming of each other

[Pre-Chorus: Haerin & Hanni, Minji & Danielle]
You may be on my mind (Mind)
Everyday baby, say you're mine (Mine)
You and me on my mind (Mind)
Everywhere, baby, say you're mine (Mine)
It feels

[Chorus: Hanni, Hyein, Haerin]
(It feels)
Cool with you (너랑)
Cool with you (Gotta tell me now)
Cool with you (It's just)
Cool with you (Haha)
[Verse 2: Minji, Hyein]
이쯤에서 정말로
너는 어떤 결말로
가려 해
What's the best
너의 옆에 내가 있을 때
이런 말이 잘 안 나와
이제 더 말하지 않아도 알아
우리 둘이 만든 거리
건너서 여기

[Pre-Chorus: Danielle & Haerin, Hanni & Hyein]
You may be on my mind (Mind)
Everyday baby, say you're mine (Mine)
You and me on my mind
Everywhere, baby, say you're mine
It feels

[Chorus: Haerin, Danielle, Hyein, Hanni, *Minji*]
Cool with you (너랑)
Cool with you (Gotta tell me now)
Cool with you (It just)
Cool with you (Haha)
Cool with you (*너랑*; You know me like no other)
Cool with you (*Gotta tell me now*)
Cool with you (It just; See me like no other)
Cool with you (Haha)
